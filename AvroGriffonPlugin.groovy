    String description = '''
Provides integration with [Apache Avro][1] – a data serialization system used by Apache Hadoop.

Usage
-----
Place your `.apvr` and/or `.apsc` sources at `$basedir/src/avro`. They will be automatically compiled to java sources
(and classes) whenever the application is compiled. Alternatively you may call the `avro` command to compile avro
sources at any time.

Scripts
-------

 * **avro** - compiles avro sources (.avro) then compiles the generated java sources.
